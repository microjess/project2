# Sustainable Clothing E-Commerce Application for a Better World

# Link to Deployed Application
[Application](https://groupprojectii-app.herokuapp.com/)

# Overview 
"Fast fashion" is at an all-time high with e-commerce companies producing mass quantities of clothing. Unfortunately, with "fast fashion" comes unethical sourcing and production and often poor factory conditions for workers. Our e-commerce site focuses on sustainable clothing that has transparency around fabric, production, and factory conditions. With integrated Stripe API, customers can add and purchase sustainable clothing directly from our site.
